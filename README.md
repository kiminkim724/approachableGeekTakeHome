This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

Install the dependencies first

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Android Emulator:

Before starting the application, you should have an emulator set up in Android Studio, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

I used to Pixel XL API 30 running on Android 11 to test/run my application.

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

Or you could press 'a' in the Metro Bundler terminal to open the app.

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
